  # This tells Nginx to cache open file handles, "not found" errors, metadata about files
  # and their permissions, etc. The upside of this is that Nginx can immediately begin
  # sending data when a popular file is requested, and will also know to immediately send
  # a 404 if a file is missing on disk, and so on. However, it also means that the server
  # won't react immediately to changes on disk, which may be undesirable. In the configuration below,
  # inactive files are released from the cache after 20 seconds, whereas active (recently requested)
  # files are re-validated every 30 seconds.
  #
  # Descriptors will not be cached unless they are used at least 2 times within 20 seconds (the inactive time).
  # A maximum of the 1000 most recently used file descriptors can be cached at any time. Production servers with
  # stable file collections will definitely want to enable the cache.
